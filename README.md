# rust_http_server
**Description :** An implementation of a http server from scratch in Rust.
**References:** [Official Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html)
## Overview: 
I am following the official documentation of Rust Programming language to learn and practice Rust. The purpose of this whole exercise is to
develop in-depth understanding of Rust programming and its usage in creating systems like Vector Dbs, Client-side ML frameworks among many. 
However, I did not want to read the whole documentation at first and then move to their last section which is building a HTTP server from scratch. So, I have started to implement the project in increments while learning the theory as and when i come across those concepts in development process. I am maintaining a [Reading list](./reading_list.md) which highlights the concepts I learnt on each day of the development sprint.
